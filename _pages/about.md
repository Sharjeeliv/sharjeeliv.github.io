I’m Sharjeel, an MSc candidate at the [University of Windsor](https://www.uwindsor.ca), where I conduct research in the Computational Biology Lab under the co-supervision of Dr. Luis Rueda and Dr. Alioune Ngom. My work focuses on graph representation learning, with a particular emphasis on hypergraph theory for deep learning, multi-modality, and heterophily.

Hypergraphs, as a generalization of graphs, can capture higher-order interactions and integrate multiple data modalities, making them well-suited for modeling complex systems. I develop and apply hypergraph-based methods in domains such as cell-cell communication, healthcare, and commerce.

Beyond my graduate research, I have industry and academic experience across machine learning, NLP, and software development. At Swift Medical, I worked as an R&D Data Scientist, contributing to a prototype for a large-scale initiative using LLMs for information extraction, for which I was given a co-op award. I’ve also held roles as a research assistant, teaching assistant, and backend software developer, with experience spanning text extraction, graph databases (Neo4J), and full ML pipelines.

I hold a BSc in Computer Science and Software Engineering from the University of Windsor, where I received several academic honors, including the Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS), Vector Institute Scholarship, and institutional awards such as the Gold LEAD Medal, Co-op Award, Great Distinction, and the Outstanding Scholars Medal.
