I’m Sharjeel, an MSc candidate at the [University of Windsor](https://www.uwindsor.ca), where I conduct research in the Computational Biology Lab under the co-supervision of Dr. Luis Rueda and Dr. Alioune Ngom. My work focuses on **Graph Representation Learning**, with a particular emphasis on hypergraph theory for **deep learning, multi-modality, and heterophily**.

Hypergraphs, as a generalization of graphs, can capture **higher-order interactions** and **multi-modal data**, making them well-suited for modeling complex systems. I develop and apply hypergraph-based methods in domains such as **cell-cell communication, drug-drug interactions, healthcare, and commerce**.

Beyond my graduate research, I have industry and academic experience across machine learning, NLP, and software development. At Swift Medical, I worked as an R&D Data Scientist, contributing to a prototype for a large-scale initiative using **Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction**, for which I was given a [co-op award](https://www.uwindsor.ca/dailynews/full-issue/2024-03-22). I’ve also held roles as a research assistant, teaching assistant, and backend software developer, with experience spanning text extraction, graph databases (Neo4J), and full ML pipelines.

I hold a BSc in Computer Science and Software Engineering from the University of Windsor, where I received several academic honors, including the **Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS), [Vector Scholarship in AI](https://vectorinstitute.ai/ontario-ai-talent-gets-2-1-million-boost-as-vector-institute-awards-120-graduate-scholarships/)**, and institutional awards such as the Gold LEAD Medal, Co-op Award, Great Distinction, and the Outstanding Scholars Medal.
